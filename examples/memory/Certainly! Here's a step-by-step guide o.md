Certainly! Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set up an external app to block merges using the GitHub Statuses API:

## Setting Up an External App to Block Merges on GitHub

### Prerequisites:

1. A GitHub account and a repository to work with.
2. An external app or service that you want to integrate with GitHub (e.g., a CI/CD system, code quality checker, etc.).
3. Access to the GitHub API, which you can use directly or via a client library like Octokit.

### Steps:

#### 1. **Generate a Personal Access Token on GitHub**:

- Go to your GitHub settings.
- Navigate to "Developer settings" > "Personal access tokens".
- Click "Generate new token".
- Select the necessary scopes for your token. At a minimum, you'll need `repo:status` to set commit statuses.
- Click "Generate token" and save the generated token securely.

#### 2. **Configure Your External App**:

- Integrate the GitHub API into your external app. If you're using a language supported by Octokit, it can simplify the API interactions.
- Use the Personal Access Token generated in step 1 for authentication.

#### 3. **Set Commit Statuses from Your External App**:

- After your external app completes its task (e.g., running tests), determine if the task was successful or failed.
- Use the [Statuses API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#statuses) to set the commit status:
  - `POST /repos/:owner/:repo/statuses/:sha`
  - Set the `state` parameter to either `success` or `failure` based on your app's results.
  - Provide a `context` (e.g., "ci/tests") to differentiate this status from others.
  - Optionally, add a `description` and `target_url` for more details.

#### 4. **Configure Branch Protection on GitHub**:

- Go to your repository settings on GitHub.
- Navigate to "Branches" > "Branch protection rules".
- Click "Add rule" or edit an existing rule.
- Under "Protect matching branches", specify the branches you want to protect (e.g., `main`).
- Under "Require status checks to pass before merging", enable the toggle.
- In the list of status checks, select the `context` you used when setting the commit status from your external app.
- Ensure "Include administrators" is checked if you want to enforce the rules even for administrators.
- Save the changes.

#### 5. **Test the Setup**:

- Create a pull request targeting the protected branch.
- Observe that the pull request cannot be merged until the required status check (from your external app) passes.
- If the status check fails, the merge will be blocked, and you'll see a message indicating the failed check.

By following this guide, you'll have set up an external app to block merges on GitHub using the Statuses API. Whenever the external app reports a failure, merges into the protected branch will be prevented until the issue is resolved.
