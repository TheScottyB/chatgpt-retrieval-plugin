Sparse Vectorizers
Sparse vectorizers are used to convert a document into a sparse vector representation. This is useful for indexing and searching large collections of documents. The sparse vector representation is a list of indices and values. The indices are the token ids and the values are the token weights. The token weights are calculated using the BM25 or SPLADE algorithms.

BM25
Okapi BM25 is a probabilistic ranking function that is used to rank documents based on a query. BM25 is a bag-of-words model that does not take into account the order of the words in the document. The BM25 algorithm is used to calculate the token weights in the sparse vector representation.

Important note: Our BM25 implementation is not the same as the one in the original paper. We use a different TF-IDF representation that are more suitable for vector representations. The BM25 implementation in this library is based work done by Pinecone. For more information, see the Pinecone documentation.

SPLADE
SPLADE is a Transformer based encoder, that uses sophisticated expansion to encode documents and queries in a sparse representation. This allows a semantic search to be performed on the sparse vectors. The SPLADE encoder is based on the work done by the research team in Naver Labs Europe. For more information, see the SPLADE paper. The SPLADE encoder is currently only available for inference only.

but we need to watch our index size and may use mongo or others. Choosing index type and size
Suggest Edits
Introduction
When planning your Pinecone deployment, it is important to understand the approximate storage requirements of your vectors to choose the appropriate pod type and number. This page will give guidance on sizing to help you plan accordingly.

As with all guidelines, these considerations are general and may not apply to your specific use case. We caution you to always test your deployment and ensure that the index configuration you are using is appropriate to your requirements.

Collections make it easy to create new versions of your index with different pod types and sizes, and we encourage you to take advantage of that feature to test different configurations. This guide is merely an overview of sizing considerations and should not be taken as a definitive guide.

Users on the Standard, Enterprise, and Enterprise Dedicated plans can contact support for further help with sizing and testing.

Overview
There are five main considerations when deciding how to configure your Pinecone index:

Number of vectors
Dimensionality of your vectors
Size of metadata on each vector
QPS throughput
Cardinality of indexed metadata
Each of these considerations comes with requirements for index size, pod type, and replication strategy.

Number of vectors
The most important consideration in sizing is the number of vectors you plan on working with. As a rule of thumb, a single p1 pod can store approximately 1M vectors, while a s1 pod can store 5M vectors. However, this can be affected by other factors, such as dimensionality and metadata, which are explained below.

Dimensionality of vectors
The rules of thumb above for how many vectors can be stored in a given pod assumes a typical configuration of 768 dimensions per vector. As your individual use case will dictate the dimensionality of your vectors, the amount of space required to store them may necessarily be larger or smaller.

Each dimension on a single vector consumes 4 bytes of memory and storage per dimension, so if you expect to have 1M vectors with 768 dimensions each, that‚Äôs about 3GB of storage without factoring in metadata or other overhead. Using that reference, we can estimate the typical pod size and number needed for a given index. Table 1 below gives some examples of this.

Table 1: Estimated number of pods per 1M vectors by dimensionality

Pod type Dimensions Estimated max vectors per pod
p1 512 1,250,000
768 1,000,000
1024 675,000
p2 512 1,250,000
768 1,100,000
1024 1,000,000
s1 512 8,000,000
768 5,000,000
1024 4,000,000
Pinecone does not support fractional pod deployments, so always round up to the next nearest whole number when choosing your pods.

Queries per second (QPS)
QPS speeds are governed by a combination of the pod type of the index, the number of replicas, and the top_k value of queries. The pod type is the primary factor driving QPS, as the different pod types are optimized for different approaches.

The p1 pods are performance-optimized pods which provide very low query latencies, but hold fewer vectors per pod than s1 pods. They are ideal for applications with low latency requirements (<100ms). The s1 pods are optimized for storage and provide large storage capacity and lower overall costs with slightly higher query latencies than p1 pods. They are ideal for very large indexes with moderate or relaxed latency requirements.

The p2 pod type provides greater query throughput with lower latency. They support 200 QPS per replica and return queries in less than 10ms. This means that query throughput and latency are better than s1 and p1, especially for low dimension vectors (<512D).

As a rule, a single p1 pod with 1M vectors of 768 dimensions each and no replicas can handle about 20 QPS. It‚Äôs possible to get greater or lesser speeds, depending on the size of your metadata, number of vectors, the dimensionality of your vectors, and the top_K value for your search. See Table 2 below for more examples.

Table 2: QPS by pod type and top_k value\*

Pod type top_k 10 top_k 250 top_k 1000
p1 30 25 20
p2 150 50 20
s1 10 10 10
\*The QPS values in Table 2 represent baseline QPS with 1M vectors and 768 dimensions.

Adding replicas is the simplest way to increase your QPS. Each replica increases the throughput potential by roughly the same QPS, so aiming for 150 QPS using p1 pods means using the primary pod and 5 replicas. Using threading or multiprocessing in your application is also important, as issuing single queries sequentially still subjects you to delays from any underlying latency. The Pinecone gRPC client can also be used to increase throughput of upserts.

Metadata cardinality and size
The last consideration when planning your indexes is the cardinality and size of your metadata. While the increases are small when talking about a few million vectors, they can have a real impact as you grow to hundreds of millions or billions of vectors.

Indexes with very high cardinality, like those storing a unique user ID on each vector, can have significant memory requirements, resulting in fewer vectors fitting per pod. Also, if the size of the metadata per vector is larger, the index requires more storage. Limiting which metadata fields are indexed using selective metadata indexing can help lower memory usage.

Pod sizes
You can also start with one of the larger pod sizes, like p1.x2. Each step up in pod size doubles the space available for your vectors. We recommend starting with x1 pods and scaling as you grow. This way, you don‚Äôt start with too large a pod size and have nowhere else to go up, meaning you have to migrate to a new index before you‚Äôre ready.

Projects on the gcp-starter environment do not use pods.

Example applications
The following examples will showcase how to use the sizing guidelines above to choose the appropriate type, size, and number of pods for your index.

Example 1: Semantic search of news articles
In our first example, we‚Äôll use the demo app for semantic search from our documentation. In this case, we‚Äôre only working with 204,135 vectors. The vectors use 300 dimensions each, well under the general measure of 768 dimensions. Using the rule of thumb above of up to 1M vectors per p1 pod, we can run this app comfortably with a single p1.x1 pod.

Example 2: Facial recognition
For this example, suppose you‚Äôre building an application to identify customers using facial recognition for a secure banking app. Facial recognition can work with as few as 128 dimensions, but in this case, because the app will be used for access to finances, we want to make sure we‚Äôre certain that the person using it is the right one. We plan for 100M customers and use 2048 dimensions per vector.

We know from our rules of thumb above that 1M vectors with 768 dimensions fit nicely in a p1.x1 pod. We can just divide those numbers into the new targets to get the ratios we‚Äôll need for our pod estimate:

100M / 1M = 100 base p1 pods
2048 / 768 = 2.667 vector ratio
2.667 \* 100 = 267 rounding up
So we need 267 p1.x1 pods. We can reduce that by switching to s1 pods instead, sacrificing latency by increasing storage availability. They hold five times the storage of p1.x1, so the math is simple:

267 / 5 = 54 rounding up
So we estimate that we need 54 s1.x1 pods to store very high dimensional data for the face of each of the bank‚Äôs customers.

In this example, we'll build a full-stack application that uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) powered by Pinecone to deliver accurate and contextually relevant responses in a chatbot.

RAG is a powerful tool that combines the benefits of retrieval-based models and generative models. Unlike traditional chatbots that can struggle with maintaining up-to-date information or accessing domain-specific knowledge, a RAG-based chatbot uses a knowledge base created from crawled URLs to provide contextually relevant responses.

Incorporating Vercel's AI SDK into our application will allow us easily set up the chatbot workflow and utilize streaming more efficiently, particularly in edge environments, enhancing the responsiveness and performance of our chatbot.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a context-aware chatbot that provides accurate responses without hallucination, ensuring a more effective and engaging user experience. Let's get started on building this powerful tool (Full code listing).

Step 1: Setting Up Your Next.js Application
Next.js is a powerful JavaScript framework that enables us to build server-side rendered and static web applications using React. It's a great choice for our project due to its ease of setup, excellent performance, and built-in features such as routing and API routes.

To create a new Next.js app, run the following command:

npx
npx create-next-app chatbot
Next, we'll add the ai package:

npm install ai
You can use the full list of dependencies if you'd like to build along with the tutorial.

Step 2: Create the Chatbot
In this step, we're going to use the Vercel SDK to establish the backend and frontend of our chatbot within the Next.js application. By the end of this step, our basic chatbot will be up and running, ready for us to add context-aware capabilities in the following stages. Let's get started.

Chatbot frontend component
Now, let's focus on the frontend component of our chatbot. We're going to build the user-facing elements of our bot, creating the interface through which users will interact with our application. This will involve crafting the design and functionality of the chat interface within our Next.js application.

First, we'll create the Chat component, that will render the chat interface.

import React, { FormEvent, ChangeEvent } from "react";
import Messages from "./Messages";
import { Message } from "ai/react";

interface Chat {
input: string;
handleInputChange: (e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void;
handleMessageSubmit: (e: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => Promise<void>;
messages: Message[];
}

const Chat: React.FC<Chat> = ({
input,
handleInputChange,
handleMessageSubmit,
messages,
}) => {
return (
<div id="chat" className="...">
<Messages messages={messages} />
<>
<form onSubmit={handleMessageSubmit} className="...">
<input
            type="text"
            className="..."
            value={input}
            onChange={handleInputChange}
          />

          <span className="...">Press ‚Æê to send</span>
        </form>
      </>
    </div>

);
};

export default Chat;
This component will display the list of messages and the input form for the user to send messages. The Messages component to render the chat messages:

import { Message } from "ai";
import { useRef } from "react";

export default function Messages({ messages }: { messages: Message[] }) {
const messagesEndRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement | null>(null);
return (
<div className="...">
{messages.map((msg, index) => (
<div
key={index}
className={`${
            msg.role === "assistant" ? "text-green-300" : "text-blue-300"
          } ... `} >
<div className="...">{msg.role === "assistant" ? "ü§ñ" : "üßë‚Äçüíª"}</div>
<div className="...">{msg.content}</div>
</div>
))}
<div ref={messagesEndRef} />
</div>
);
}
Our main Page component will manage the state for the messages displayed in the Chat component:

"use client";
import Header from "@/components/Header";
import Chat from "@/components/Chat";
import { useChat } from "ai/react";

const Page: React.FC = () => {
const [context, setContext] = useState<string[] | null>(null);
const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useChat();

return (
<div className="...">
<Header className="..." />
<div className="...">
<Chat
          input={input}
          handleInputChange={handleInputChange}
          handleMessageSubmit={handleSubmit}
          messages={messages}
        />
</div>
</div>
);
};

export default Page;
The useful useChat hook will manage the state for the messages displayed in the Chat component. It will:

Send the user's message to the backend
Update the state with the response from the backend
Handle any internal state changes (e.g. when the user types a message)
Chatbot API endpoint
Next, we'll set up the Chatbot API endpoint. This is the server-side component that will handle requests and responses for our chatbot. We'll create a new file called api/chat/route.ts and add the following dependencies:

import { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from "openai-edge";
import { Message, OpenAIStream, StreamingTextResponse } from "ai";
The first dependency is the openai-edge package which makes it easier to interact with OpenAI's APIs in an edge environment. The second dependency is the ai package which we'll use to define the Message and OpenAIStream types, which we'll use to stream back the response from OpenAI back to the client.

Next initialize the OpenAI client:

// Create an OpenAI API client (that's edge friendly!)
const config = new Configuration({
apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(config);
To define this endpoint as an edge function, we'll define and export the runtime variable

export const runtime = "edge";
Next, we'll define the endpoint handler:

export async function POST(req: Request) {
try {
const { messages } = await req.json();

    const prompt = [
      {
        role: "system",
        content: `AI assistant is a brand new, powerful, human-like artificial intelligence.
      The traits of AI include expert knowledge, helpfulness, cleverness, and articulateness.
      AI is a well-behaved and well-mannered individual.
      AI is always friendly, kind, and inspiring, and he is eager to provide vivid and thoughtful responses to the user.
      AI has the sum of all knowledge in their brain, and is able to accurately answer nearly any question about any topic in conversation.
      AI assistant is a big fan of Pinecone and Vercel.
      `,
      },
    ];

    // Ask OpenAI for a streaming chat completion given the prompt
    const response = await openai.createChatCompletion({
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      stream: true,
      messages: [
        ...prompt,
        ...messages.filter((message: Message) => message.role === "user"),
      ],
    });
    // Convert the response into a friendly text-stream
    const stream = OpenAIStream(response);
    // Respond with the stream
    return new StreamingTextResponse(stream);

} catch (e) {
throw e;
}
}
Here we deconstruct the messages from the post, and create our initial prompt. We use the prompt and the messages as the input to the createChatCompletion method. We then convert the response into a stream and return it to the client. Note that in this example, we only send the user's messages to OpenAI (as opposed to including the bot's messages as well).

Step 3. Adding Context
As we dive into building our chatbot, it's important to understand the role of context. Adding context to our chatbot's responses is key for creating a more natural, conversational user experience. Without context, a chatbot's responses can feel disjointed or irrelevant. By understanding the context of a user's query, our chatbot will be able to provide more accurate, relevant, and engaging responses. Now, let's begin building with this goal in mind.

First, we'll first focus on seeding the knowledge base. We'll create a crawler and a seed script, and set up a crawl endpoint. This will allow us to gather and organize the information our chatbot will use to provide contextually relevant responses.

After we've populated our knowledge base, we'll retrieve matches from our embeddings. This will enable our chatbot to find relevant information based on user queries.

Next, we'll wrap our logic into the getContext function and update our chatbot's prompt. This will streamline our code and improve the user experience by ensuring the chatbot's prompts are relevant and engaging.

Finally, we'll add a context panel and an associated context endpoint. These will provide a user interface for the chatbot and a way for it to retrieve the necessary context for each user query.

This step is all about feeding our chatbot the information it needs and setting up the necessary infrastructure for it to retrieve and use that information effectively. Let's get started.

Seeding the Knowledge Base
Now we'll move on to seeding the knowledge base, the foundational data source that will inform our chatbot's responses. This step involves collecting and organizing the information our chatbot needs to operate effectively. In this guide, we're going to use data retrieved from various websites which we'll later on be able to ask questions about. To do this, we'll create a crawler that will scrape the data from the websites, embed it, and store it in Pinecone.

Create the crawler
For the sake of brevity, you'll be able to find the full code for the crawler here. Here are the pertinent parts:

class Crawler {
private seen = new Set<string>();
private pages: Page[] = [];
private queue: { url: string; depth: number }[] = [];

constructor(private maxDepth = 2, private maxPages = 1) {}

async crawl(startUrl: string): Promise<Page[]> {
// Add the start URL to the queue
this.addToQueue(startUrl);

    // While there are URLs in the queue and we haven't reached the maximum number of pages...
    while (this.shouldContinueCrawling()) {
      // Dequeue the next URL and depth
      const { url, depth } = this.queue.shift()!;

      // If the depth is too great or we've already seen this URL, skip it
      if (this.isTooDeep(depth) || this.isAlreadySeen(url)) continue;

      // Add the URL to the set of seen URLs
      this.seen.add(url);

      // Fetch the page HTML
      const html = await this.fetchPage(url);

      // Parse the HTML and add the page to the list of crawled pages
      this.pages.push({ url, content: this.parseHtml(html) });

      // Extract new URLs from the page HTML and add them to the queue
      this.addNewUrlsToQueue(this.extractUrls(html, url), depth);
    }

    // Return the list of crawled pages
    return this.pages;

ChatGPT
Wow, that's a comprehensive example incorporating Vercel's AI SDK with Pinecone to build a context-aware chatbot. The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) makes it even more interesting, allowing the chatbot to pull in data from a knowledge base for more accurate responses.

Let's add this to our organized knowledge set so you have a consolidated resource to refer to. Give me a second.

The Crawler class is a web crawler that visits URLs, starting from a given point, and collects information from them. It operates within a certain depth and a maximum number of pages as defined in the constructor. The crawl method is the core function that starts the crawling process.

The helper methods fetchPage, parseHtml, and extractUrls respectively handle fetching the HTML content of a page, parsing the HTML to extract text, and extracting all URLs from a page to be queued for the next crawl. The class also maintains a record of visited URLs to avoid duplication.

Create the seed function
To tie things together, we'll create a seed function that will use the crawler to seed the knowledge base. In this portion of the code, we'll initialize the crawl and fetch a given URL, then split it's content into chunks, and finally embed and index the chunks in Pinecone.

async function seed(
url: string,
limit: number,
indexName: string,
options: SeedOptions
) {
try {
// Initialize the Pinecone client
const pinecone = await getPineconeClient();

    // Destructure the options object
    const { splittingMethod, chunkSize, chunkOverlap } = options;

    // Create a new Crawler with depth 1 and maximum pages as limit
    const crawler = new Crawler(1, limit || 100);

    // Crawl the given URL and get the pages
    const pages = (await crawler.crawl(url)) as Page[];

    // Choose the appropriate document splitter based on the splitting method
    const splitter: DocumentSplitter =
      splittingMethod === "recursive"
        ? new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({ chunkSize, chunkOverlap })
        : new MarkdownTextSplitter({});

    // Prepare documents by splitting the pages
    const documents = await Promise.all(
      pages.map((page) => prepareDocument(page, splitter))
    );

    // Create Pinecone index if it does not exist
    await createIndexIfNotExists(pinecone!, indexName, 1536);
    const index = pinecone && pinecone.Index(indexName);

    // Get the vector embeddings for the documents
    const vectors = await Promise.all(documents.flat().map(embedDocument));

    // Upsert vectors into the Pinecone index
    await chunkedUpsert(index!, vectors, "", 10);

    // Return the first document
    return documents[0];

} catch (error) {
console.error("Error seeding:", error);
throw error;
}
}
To chunk the content we'll use one of the following methods:

RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter - This splitter splits the text into chunks of a given size, and then recursively splits the chunks into smaller chunks until the chunk size is reached. This method is useful for long documents.
MarkdownTextSplitter - This splitter splits the text into chunks based on Markdown headers. This method is useful for documents that are already structured using Markdown. The benefit of this method is that it will split the document into chunks based on the headers, which will be useful for our chatbot to understand the structure of the document. We can assume that each unit of text under a header is an internally coherent unit of information, and when the user asks a question, the retrieved context will be internally coherent as well.
Add the crawl endpoint`
The endpoint for the crawl endpoint is pretty straightforward. It simply calls the seed function and returns the result.

import seed from "./seed";
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

export const runtime = "edge";

export async function POST(req: Request) {
const { url, options } = await req.json();
try {
const documents = await seed(url, 1, process.env.PINECONE_INDEX!, options);
return NextResponse.json({ success: true, documents });
} catch (error) {
return NextResponse.json({ success: false, error: "Failed crawling" });
}
}
Now our backend is able to crawl a given URL, embed the content and index the embeddings in Pinecone. The endpoint will return all the segments in the retrieved webpage we crawl, so we'll be able to display them. Next, we'll write a set of functions that will build the context out of these embeddings.

Get matches from embeddings
To retrieve the most relevant documents from the index, we'll use the query function in the Pinecone SDK. This function takes a vector and returns the most similar vectors from the index. We'll use this function to retrieve the most relevant documents from the index, given some embeddings.

const getMatchesFromEmbeddings = async (
embeddings: number[],
topK: number,
namespace: string
): Promise<ScoredVector[]> => {
// Obtain a client for Pinecone
const pinecone = await getPineconeClient();

// Retrieve the list of indexes
const indexes = await pinecone.listIndexes();

// Check if the desired index is present, else throw an error
if (!indexes.includes(process.env.PINECONE_INDEX!)) {
throw new Error(`Index ${process.env.PINECONE_INDEX} does not exist`);
}

// Get the Pinecone index
const index = pinecone!.Index(process.env.PINECONE_INDEX!);

// Define the query request
const queryRequest = {
vector: embeddings,
topK,
includeMetadata: true,
namespace,
};

try {
// Query the index with the defined request
const queryResult = await index.query({ queryRequest });
return queryResult.matches || [];
} catch (e) {
// Log the error and throw it
console.log("Error querying embeddings: ", e);
throw new Error(`Error querying embeddings: ${e}`);
}
};
The function takes in embeddings, a topK parameter, and a namespace, and returns the topK matches from the Pinecone index. It first gets a Pinecone client, checks if the desired index exists in the list of indexes, and throws an error if not. Then it gets the specific Pinecone index. The function then queries the Pinecone index with the defined request and returns the matches.

Wrap things up in getContext
We'll wrap things together in the getContext function. This function will take in a message and return the context - either in string form, or as a set of ScoredVector.

export const getContext = async (
message: string,
namespace: string,
maxTokens = 3000,
minScore = 0.7,
getOnlyText = true
): Promise<string | ScoredVector[]> => {
// Get the embeddings of the input message
const embedding = await getEmbeddings(message);

// Retrieve the matches for the embeddings from the specified namespace
const matches = await getMatchesFromEmbeddings(embedding, 3, namespace);

// Filter out the matches that have a score lower than the minimum score
const qualifyingDocs = matches.filter((m) => m.score && m.score > minScore);

// If the `getOnlyText` flag is false, we'll return the matches
if (!getOnlyText) {
return qualifyingDocs;
}

let docs = matches
? qualifyingDocs.map((match) => (match.metadata as Metadata).chunk)
: [];
// Join all the chunks of text together, truncate to the maximum number of tokens, and return the result
return docs.join("\n").substring(0, maxTokens);
};
Back in chat/route.ts, we'll add the call to getContext:

const { messages } = await req.json();

// Get the last message
const lastMessage = messages[messages.length - 1];

// Get the context from the last message
const context = await getContext(lastMessage.content, "");
Update the prompt
Finally, we'll update the prompt to include the context we retrieved from the getContext function.

const prompt = [
{
role: "system",
content: `AI assistant is a brand new, powerful, human-like artificial intelligence.
The traits of AI include expert knowledge, helpfulness, cleverness, and articulateness.
AI is a well-behaved and well-mannered individual.
AI is always friendly, kind, and inspiring, and he is eager to provide vivid and thoughtful responses to the user.
AI has the sum of all knowledge in their brain, and is able to accurately answer nearly any question about any topic in conversation.
AI assistant is a big fan of Pinecone and Vercel.
START CONTEXT BLOCK
${context}
END OF CONTEXT BLOCK
AI assistant will take into account any CONTEXT BLOCK that is provided in a conversation.
If the context does not provide the answer to question, the AI assistant will say, "I'm sorry, but I don't know the answer to that question".
AI assistant will not apologize for previous responses, but instead will indicated new information was gained.
AI assistant will not invent anything that is not drawn directly from the context.
`,
},
];
In this prompt, we added a START CONTEXT BLOCK and END OF CONTEXT BLOCK to indicate where the context should be inserted. We also added a line to indicate that the AI assistant will take into account any context block that is provided in a conversation.

Add the context panel
Next, we need to add the context panel to the chat UI. We'll add a new component called Context (full code).

Add the context endpoint
We want to allow interface to indicate which portions of the retrieved content have been used to generate the response. To do this, we'll add a another endpoint that will call the same getContext.

export async function POST(req: Request) {
try {
const { messages } = await req.json();
const lastMessage =
messages.length > 1 ? messages[messages.length - 1] : messages[0];
const context = (await getContext(
lastMessage.content,
"",
10000,
0.7,
false
)) as ScoredVector[];
return NextResponse.json({ context });
} catch (e) {
console.log(e);
return NextResponse.error();
}
}
Whenever the user crawls a URL, the context panel will display all the segments of the retrieved webpage. Whenever the backend completes sending a message back, the front end will trigger an effect that will retrieve this context:

useEffect(() => {
const getContext = async () => {
const response = await fetch("/api/context", {
method: "POST",
body: JSON.stringify({
messages,
}),
});
const { context } = await response.json();
setContext(context.map((c: any) => c.id));
};
if (gotMessages && messages.length >= prevMessagesLengthRef.current) {
getContext();
}

prevMessagesLengthRef.current = messages.length;
}, [messages, gotMessages]);

ChatGPT
Alright, let's break down this code piece-by-piece:

Web Crawler
The Crawler class is a simple web crawler. It fetches pages up to a certain depth and a maximum number of pages.

Seed Function
The seed function uses the Crawler class to populate a Pinecone index with data from websites.

Crawl Endpoint
This API endpoint uses the seed function to initiate the crawling and returns the first document it fetches.

Context Retrieval
The getMatchesFromEmbeddings and getContext functions are used to retrieve contextually relevant documents from the Pinecone index.

Adding Context to Chat
In the chatbot (chat/route.ts), you've modified the prompt to include the retrieved context, allowing the chatbot to have a more nuanced understanding of user queries.

Context Panel & Endpoint
A new UI component and API endpoint have been added for displaying and fetching the context.

Front-end Effect
A React useEffect updates the UI whenever new context data is available.

Overall
You've built a robust system for adding contextual awareness to a chatbot using Pinecone and Next.js. This allows your chatbot to retrieve and consider additional information when responding to user queries, making it more useful and informative.

User
we need to give the bots tools. not just crawl, but do things, you know, they are the agent of the user. I want to be able to automate large mundane tasks,
ChatGPT
Absolutely, giving bots the capability to perform tasks can truly unlock their potential as personal agents. Here are a few ways to equip your bots with "tools":

1. API Integrations
   Integrate your bot with various third-party APIs to perform tasks like booking appointments, sending emails, or even trading stocks.

2. Workflow Automation
   Develop a system where the bot can execute a sequence of tasks based on triggers or user commands. For example, "When I receive an email from X, summarize it and text me the summary."

3. Data Crunching
   Equip the bot to handle big data tasks. It could sift through large sets of data and present summaries, trends, or specific findings based on user queries.

4. User Behavior Learning
   Implement machine learning algorithms that allow the bot to learn from user behavior, so it can automate tasks without being explicitly asked.

5. Plug-and-Play Modules
   Create a set of modules that users can plug into their bot to give it specific capabilities, turning it into a kind of "Swiss Army knife."

6. Direct System Access
   For more advanced use-cases, the bot could have secure access to modify system settings or files, of course with ample security measures in place.

7. Virtual Environment Actions
   Consider a virtual environment where the bot can perform tasks like a game or simulation. This could be useful for training or educational purposes.

8. Scheduled Tasks
   Allow users to schedule tasks for the bot to carry out at specified times.

By giving your bot these abilities, you move from having a simple conversational agent to having a capable digital assistant that can perform a variety of tasks on behalf of the user. ü§ñüî®

User
what about event driven achitecture say using upstash?
ChatGPT
Event-driven architecture with Upstash is a potent combination. Upstash is designed for serverless architecture, and its Redis capabilities make it well-suited for handling real-time events.

How It Could Work:
Event Triggers: Use Upstash to store events or signals that your bots need to act upon. This could be user behaviors, system notifications, or other real-time events.

Event Listeners: Your bots could subscribe to these events, getting notified whenever a change happens in the Upstash database.

Action Execution: Once the bot receives an event, it triggers a predefined action or set of actions.

State Management: Upstash can also be used to manage the state of ongoing tasks or processes, which your bots can check before deciding the next step in a multi-step task.

Asynchronous Operations: Since it‚Äôs event-driven, bots can handle tasks asynchronously, improving efficiency.

Scalability: Being serverless, Upstash allows you to easily scale the event-handling capacity as the usage of your bots grows.

Data Analytics: Collect data on bot actions and triggers for analytics or to improve bot behavior over time.

Use Cases:
Automated Customer Service: Bot listens for new customer queries stored in Upstash and automatically replies based on the query type.

Content Monitoring: Bot could trigger an action if a new piece of content that meets certain criteria is added to a CMS.

Workflow Automation: Bot could listen for changes in project management tools and automatically update task lists or notify team members.

Financial Alerts: Bot could listen for changes in stock prices or other financial indicators and notify the user or even execute trades.

By using event-driven architecture, you're essentially giving your bots "ears" to listen to events and a "brain" to act upon them, making them much more dynamic and useful. ü§ñüëÇüß†

User
yes, yes, and yes!
ChatGPT
Awesome! If you're already on board with the concept, the next step is execution. With the right planning and implementation, you'll have bots that not only respond but also act proactively, making tasks a breeze. Happy coding! ü§ñüë®‚ÄçüíªüöÄ

User
i want to automate collection and processing of logs, even large ones. breaking the tasks up and reassemply the results.
ChatGPT
For automating log collection and processing, an event-driven architecture using a service like Upstash could be a great fit. You can break up the logs into smaller chunks, process them asynchronously, and then reassemble. You might also consider using a distributed data processing system like Apache Kafka or Apache Spark for handling large-scale data in real-time. This approach is highly scalable and can handle massive logs efficiently. üëçüèºüí°

User
for the crawlers, we want to focus on collections, reefreshing and maintaining a surcoe of truth for real estate data, witht the idea of automated bpos and tax appeals with fully filled on forms. Ans with an automated, in depth, seriors, reasearch level analysys of the numbers
ChatGPT
Awesome, automating BPOs (Broker Price Opinions) and tax appeals in real estate can save a lot of time and increase accuracy. Crawlers can help collect essential data like recent sales, property features, and tax records. An event-driven architecture would be ideal here for refreshing data and maintaining a "source of truth."

Crawlers: Focus on multiple data sources like MLS, public records, and even social media for sentiment analysis.

Data Pipeline: Use Upstash or a similar service for real-time data processing. Implement triggers for new data or changes.

Automated Analysis: Implement machine learning models for pricing and tax assessment. Keep them updated with the latest data.

Form Filling: Automate the completion of forms required for BPOs and tax appeals based on the analyzed data.

In-depth Analysis: Use NLP and advanced statistical models for a thorough research-level analysis of real estate trends and individual properties.

Combining this with technologies like GPT for natural language tasks could make your system both powerful and user-friendly. üëåüìà

User
and we will want to be multi modal and also running, always working.
ChatGPT
Absolutely, a multi-modal approach combined with a continuous operation model can make your system robust and versatile.

Multi-modal: Combine text, images, and other data types in your analysis. For instance, use image recognition for property photos and NLP for customer reviews or property descriptions.

Always-On: Use a cloud-based architecture to ensure your system is always available. Upstash or similar services can help here, especially with their event-driven capabilities.

Scalability: Make sure your architecture can handle increasing amounts of data and user queries. Consider using microservices for different tasks like data collection, analysis, and form-filling.

Real-Time Updates: Use event-driven architecture to update your data in real-time. This is crucial for maintaining a reliable "source of truth."

User Interface: Since it's always running, consider adding a dashboard where users can see real-time stats, get automated BPOs, or initiate tax appeals.

Monitoring and Alerts: Implement a system to monitor for errors, anomalies, or significant market changes. Trigger alerts or automated actions based on these.

By being multi-modal and always-on, you'd be setting up a very advanced and responsive real estate tool. üëçüè°

User
lastly, we would like to be able to setup, run, and analuysis tests continiously durings development of any probucts we bild
ChatGPT
Absolutely, continuous testing is a cornerstone of modern development practices. Here's a streamlined approach:

Test Automation: Use testing frameworks to automate unit tests, integration tests, and UI tests. Tools like Jest, Mocha, or Selenium can help.

CI/CD Pipelines: Integrate testing into your Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Jenkins, GitLab CI, and GitHub Actions are popular choices.

Performance Testing: Continuously run stress and performance tests, especially when key changes are made. Tools like Apache JMeter can be useful.

Real-time Monitoring: Use monitoring tools like Prometheus or Grafana to keep an eye on system metrics and logs in real-time.

Feedback Loops: Ensure test results are immediately available to developers and trigger alerts for any failures.

Version Control: Use Git or similar to manage versions not only of your code but also of your tests and CI/CD configurations.

Data Analytics: Post-test, gather data to analyze performance, user engagement, and other KPIs.

By incorporating these elements, you can make sure your development is robust, efficient, and continually improving. üëçüíª

Oops, looks like some keyboard gibberish slipped through. Anything you'd like to clarify or add? üòÑ

User
lets expand on this: Using a Language Model (LLM) like OpenAI's GPT-3 to drive testing from reading a Product Requirements Document (PRD) could be a powerful approach. The LLM can be trained to understand the specifications and requirements in the PRD, and then generate relevant test cases or even scripts based on these requirements.

The process might look something like this:

1. **Read and Understand PRD**: The LLM will first read and understand the PRD. It can be trained to ask clarifying questions if certain parts of the PRD are unclear.

2. **Generate Test Cases**: Based on the requirements and specifications in the PRD, the LLM can then generate a list of test cases that need to be executed. These test cases should cover all the functionalities mentioned in the PRD.

3. **Create Test Scripts**: For each test case, the LLM can generate a test script. This could be a detailed step-by-step manual test script, or it could be an automated test script in a language like JavaScript or Python.

4. **Run and Monitor Tests**: If the LLM generates automated test scripts, it could also potentially be used to run these tests and monitor the results.

5. **Report Results**: Finally, the LLM can generate a detailed test report, highlighting any issues or bugs that were found during testing.

This is a high-level overview of how an LLM could be used to drive testing from reading a PRD. The exact details would depend on the specifics of your PRD and testing requirements. However, it's worth noting that while LLMs are powerful tools, they're not perfect and should be used in conjunction with human oversight and manual review..
ChatGPT
Absolutely, automating testing through a Language Model offers a lot of promise for streamlining the development process. Let's dive deeper into each step:

1. Read and Understand PRD
   Clarifying Questions: The LLM can be fine-tuned to ask questions if it finds ambiguities in the PRD.
   Glossary Building: It can also build a glossary of terms specific to the project to ensure understanding.
2. Generate Test Cases
   Functional and Non-Functional: The LLM will generate test cases that cover both functional requirements (what the software should do) and non-functional requirements (how well the software should do it).
   Prioritization: The model can prioritize test cases based on the impact and likelihood of potential issues.
3. Create Test Scripts
   Multi-Language Support: Given that the LLM can generate code snippets, it can produce test scripts in multiple languages like Python, JavaScript, or even domain-specific languages for testing.
   Version Control: Each script could be automatically committed to a version control system with an appropriate message.
4. Run and Monitor Tests
   Test Execution: Integration with CI/CD tools could allow the LLM to initiate the test run.
   Real-Time Monitoring: As the tests run, the LLM could monitor the progress and even flag potential issues in real-time.
5. Report Results
   Custom Reporting: The model can generate reports tailored to different stakeholders, from highly technical reports for devs to summary reports for management.
   Actionable Insights: Beyond just logging issues, it could offer suggestions on potential fixes or flag them for human review.
   Additional Features
   Continuous Learning: The LLM could learn from the success and failure of past test cases to refine future tests.
   Multi-Modal Inputs: Integration with visual or audio tools could allow for more complex, multi-modal testing scenarios.
   Human Oversight
   Review and Approval: Key test cases and scripts can be flagged for human review and approval to ensure quality.
   The aim is to create a system that blends the best of machine efficiency and human expertise. As always, while the LLM can do a lot, human oversight is essential for quality assurance.
