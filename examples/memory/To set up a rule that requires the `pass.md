To set up a rule that requires the `passed_audit` tag before a PR can be merged using Octokit, you'll need to update the branch protection rules for the target branch (e.g., `main` or `master`). Here's how you can do it using Octokit.js in TypeScript:

```typescript
import { Octokit } from "@octokit/rest";

// Initialize Octokit with your GitHub App's authentication token
const octokit = new Octokit({
  auth: "YOUR_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN",
});

// Function to set branch protection rule requiring the 'passed_audit' label
async function setBranchProtection(
  owner: string,
  repo: string,
  branch: string
) {
  try {
    await octokit.repos.updateBranchProtection({
      owner,
      repo,
      branch,
      required_pull_request_reviews: {
        required_approving_review_count: 2, // Number of approvals you want to require
        dismiss_stale_reviews: true,
        require_code_owner_reviews: false,
      },
      required_status_checks: {
        strict: true,
        contexts: ["passed_audit"], // This is the status check, not a label. If you want to enforce a label, GitHub doesn't support that natively in branch protection.
      },
      enforce_admins: true, // This ensures that the rules apply to repository administrators as well
      restrictions: null, // No user or team restrictions
      required_linear_history: true,
      allow_force_pushes: false,
      allow_deletions: false,
    });
    console.log(`Set branch protection rules for ${branch} in ${repo}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(
      `Failed to set branch protection rules for ${branch} in ${repo}:`,
      error
    );
  }
}

// Example usage
setBranchProtection("YourOrgOrUsername", "YourRepoName", "main");
```

Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN` with your GitHub App's authentication token.

Note: The `contexts` field in `required_status_checks` is for status checks, not labels. GitHub's branch protection doesn't natively support enforcing labels. The above code enforces a status check named `passed_audit`. If you want to enforce the presence of a label before merging, you'd need to implement a custom solution, such as a GitHub Action or a CI/CD pipeline step that checks for the label and sets a status check accordingly.
